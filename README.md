a single Person image is changed into 3D from 2D using PyTorch3D - #D Deep Learning
PIFu - Pixel-aligned Implicit Function

This proposes an end-to-end deep learning method
for digitizing highly detailed clothed humans that can infer
both 3D surface and texture from a single image, and
optionally, multiple input images. Highly intricate shapes,
such as hairstyles, clothing, as well as their variations and
deformations can be digitized in a unified way. Compared
to existing representations used for 3D deep learning, PIFu
produces high-resolution surfaces including largely unseen
regions such as the back of a person
